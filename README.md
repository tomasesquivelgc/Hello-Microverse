# Hello-Microverse
This is my repository for the "Hello-microverse" project
In this project I am putting to the test my ability to:
- create and merge branches
- add linters to my repo
- add .gitignore files

recent changes to this project include:
- a correct installation of linters using VSC's terminal
- a correct use of spacing (thanks to linters' corrections)
- further explanation of new changes and improvements to the project
